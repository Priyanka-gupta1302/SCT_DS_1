# SCT_DS_1
# DESCRIPTION 
This project demonstrates how to visualize the distribution of categorical or continuous variables using bar charts or histograms. The dataset focuses on Indiaâ€™s population distribution by age (2022), and the task is to represent the data in a meaningful and easy-to-understand format. 

# Objectives

To understand how to visualize data using bar charts and histograms.

To represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable effectively.

To analyze population data, such as age groups or gender distribution, through visual representation.

To practice data visualization skills for better insights and communication of data.

To work with a sample dataset and implement visualization using tools like Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn), Excel, or any preferred visualization software.

# Steps Performed

1. Import the dataset.
2. Clean and organize the data.
3. Create a bar chart or histogram.
4. Label the axes, title, and legends.
5. Save and interpret the visualization.

# Conclusion

Through this project, we learned how to represent population data visually, making it easier to analyze and interpret. This approach can be extended to other datasets such as gender distribution, income groups, or education levels.
